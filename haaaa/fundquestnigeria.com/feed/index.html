										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent takeover of Twitter came as a surprise to most observers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For casual observers, Elon Musk’s investment was seen as a victory for free speech more than anything else. But the truth is that nobody invests $44 billion of their money just to defend free speech. Buying Twitter was a well-thought-out move that gives Elon access to data and a worldwide market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That’s what investment is all about. It involves opportunity and requires you to think thoroughly about the opportunity. You then envision its pros and cons and invest when you have concluded on its merits or demerits.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The easiest way to be an investor is to find trusted investment managers or professionals. They are versed and knowledgeable enough to sniff out investment opportunities anywhere, depending on their sphere of influence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can invest in shares, stock, or properties, amongst other things. The twitter story is an interesting one. The outright purchase of the company yielded a windfall for shareholders and employees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A company’s growth is planned, and its employees work towards that growth over time. Growth enables the company to be financially stable.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Financial growth increases profitability along with the value of its dividends. It’s how big companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Coca-cola became big. They were publicly built over time through the sale of shares.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not every company is built in the hope of selling it off to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. But every investment in every company is created towards making a profit. This profit is then attached to the shares.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That is the essence of investment. The return on investment and the idea that money can work for you is just the whole point. This brings in extra income, and sometimes, the only source of income. There are different investment options available. From mutual funds to real estate, bonds, and many more.</span></p>
<p><strong> Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fundquest is an investment management company based in Lagos. We curate the best investment plan for you, and it doesn’t depend on your income level.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is something for all comers. The important thing is that you get returns on your investment. A return which you can decide to re-invest with or simply take to the bank.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can decide to buy shares from other companies. Not just in the hope of a takeover like in the case of Twitter, but with the idea that you can eventually become a majority shareholder. The chance of this happening is why we invest.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The chance of leaving a legacy behind and leaving something for the next generation to build on is why we invest. Visit </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="http://www.fundquestnigeria.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">www.fundquestnigeria.com</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for more on our investment options.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Imagine a child holding the hands of a parent or older relative. Imagine crossing the road without having to look right or left. All a child requires is to trust the judgement of the guardian. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That is what </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">financial advisory</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> does. A financial advisor is a professional who offers financial advisory services for a fee agreed upon by both parties.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/advisory/">Financial advisor</a> takes certain responsibilities off your hands while you focus on other things like actually making money. It involves investment management, tax planning, estate planning, etc. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is easy to frown at the need to have a financial advisor. You may feel like you have your money without them in the first place, so why should they come in to advise you and get a percentage of your money?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The truth is that you can make your money from a particular field of endeavour and not know of opportunities in other areas where you can make more money. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, you might make money as a spare parts dealer without knowing that you can also do well in Real estate. A financial advisor sees these opportunities and positions you to benefit from them. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Their service helps you<strong> build wealth faster with lesser risk.</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The relevance of a financial advisor cannot be over-emphasized. Decisions around money are the fulcrum of a healthy financial status.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A healthy financial status is the bedrock of every business organization. It extends to industries, and by extension, to the economy as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pay for a financial advisory service can be based on commission, profit-percentage structure, or both. This is an incentive for them to look for good deals and opportunities for you as a client. In clearer terms, their income is tied to the success of your venture or investment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot of different professionals are also financial advisors. They include stockbrokers, insurance agents, investment managers, and anyone whose job it is to manage your money, tax or investment. Estate planners can also be categorized as financial advisors. The important factor here is that a financial advisor must provide advice on money matters.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot of different people can claim to offer financial advisory services. For example, an estate surveyor determines the value of your property based on its location and what facilities or amenities are available. The bottom line is always about what is in it for them and what’s in it for you in the long run. There is a lot to gain from having a financial advisor readily available.

<p><b>Why FundQuest remains value-driven, dependable credit and loan firm, by Akinjayeju</b></p>
<p>FundQuest is a CBN licensed financial institution that is currently in her 10th year of operation. We operate from Nigeria’s commercial hub, Lagos State and extend our services all around the country. I must say that it has been an extreme privilege for me to serve as the Managing Director/CEO of this great financial institution over the years, says Abiodun Akinjayeju.</p>
<p>Since inception, FundQuest has been operating within the mid-tier of the Nigerian financial system, offering <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/loans/">Loans</a>, <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/leases/">Leases</a>, <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/investments/">Investments</a>, <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/investments/">Funds Management</a>, and <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/advisory/">Financial Advisory Services</a> to customers across all sectors of the economy. Our loan products have been centered around tailor made funding to registered Small and Medium Enterprises that have been in operation for at least one year. While our investment offering boasts of competitive interest rate with better returns on investment with greater flexibility for investors to access their funds than most of our competitors.</p>
<p>FundQuest has been a dependable organization (i.e. easily approachable) in this last decade, offering Funding and Financing Solutions which has added immense value to individual and MSME growth in Nigeria in a much differentiated FundQuest.  We also intend to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>2020 was a year that took the world by surprise with the global outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic shutting down world economy for months, and Nigeria was no exception. Whilst this period was filled with uncertainty, FundQuest was there in a measured and reassured way for our customers and provided our support during this turbulent period. Several clients were offered payment moratorium, interest rate concession, loan restructuring, reduced interest/charges on new loans, and free business advisory on how to navigate through the challenges associated with Covid-19. We also educated our clients on the need to have a realistic business-continuity plan and solid corporate governance structure in preparation for any future uncertainties.</p>
<p>Industries and businesses do come with their challenges, but the pertinent issues facing the financial services industry among others is ascertaining credit worthiness of clients with reliable adequate data. FundQuest has been able to work rigorously to a large extent through expertise within the organization in analysing their suitability in meeting the expectations of our clients despite the challenges on adequate data needed.</p>
<p>Apart from the varieties of products we offer to our clients, we also offer business advisory on how their businesses can grow in leaps, when and how funds can be secured and we take them by the hands to succeed in their businesses. We are intentional in doing these because granting credit to our client is not only our focus; giving business advises to help them grow makes us a better organization to partner with. This is an added value which sets us apart as an organisation.</p>
<p>Strategically, the Board of FundQuest has been able to bring in more investors to the organization as a result of our past performances which shows that we are forward-thinking in growing our business capital so that many more MSMEs and individuals would be reached and can partner with our services. This will also help to situate FundQuest as a key player in the credit space within the financial sector.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we at FundQuest (<a href="http://www.fundquestnigeria.com/">www.fundquestnigeria.com</a>) can say that adding value to our clients and MSMEs in general has not been a fluke. In the recent rise of so many loan sharks and fraudulent institutions cashing out on the gullible masses, it has been a deliberate act for FundQuest both strategically and in terms of routine operations, to uphold our mandates of being the best at what we do and we have been at this for almost a decade and counting.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge that adding value flows both ways, that is why we ensure that adequate feedbacks from all quarters (Clients, Regulators, Stakeholders etc.) are taken into consideration in order to always be better and surpasses all expectations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see money as your slave that can be sent on money-making errands, thats when you start to enjoy the fruits of your hard-earned funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing fully well that your slaves (Interests) could also serve as your money-making slave is another level of investment savviness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting interest from your capital is interesting. Getting additional interest from the initial interest on your capital is sweet in the pudding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will help you understand this concept in simple terms without the unnecessary ambiguities of financial terminologies.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Compound Interest in Simple Term</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of your money to make you money and that money to make you extra money is Compound Interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is simply reinvesting the addition of your initial capital and the interest generated on it over a period. This new addition is referred to as your new principal at the point of reinvesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reinvested capital also generates interest. And the process of adding and reinvesting is repeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repetition is known as the compounding frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When interest generates extra interest for you, that is compound interest.</span></p>
<h3><b>Simple Interest VS Compound Interest</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people are accustomed to simple interests. Simple interest calculation is the cost of borrowing or lending money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are borrowing a loan, you owe the interest. If you are investing, you earn it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, unlike compound interest, simple interest does not have any compounding effect. You only get paid your principal plus the interest agreed at maturity of the investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general terms, Compound Interest is a better and faster way to grow capital and build wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same vein, loans calculated in compound interest can be detrimental to you as a borrower. As the interest compounds, your debt increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the reasons why personal finance savvy people like you will always prefer their investment to have compound interest. And their loans are better off at simple interest calculations.</span></p>
<h4><b>Core Variables</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear investors, compound interests are not a stand-alone principle. Some factors and concepts play relevant roles in compounding.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Initial Capital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What is the amount you are starting with? Or how many loans are you accessing? Compounding is based on the initial capital you invest or borrow as the case may be.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Interest Rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The higher the rates, the more funds you earn.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tenor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Compounding is a long-term strategy. The longer the tenor, the more it compounds and this relates to your earnings over that period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Compounding Frequency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Interest compounds annually, bi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. The more frequent the compounding, the more you earn. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>How to Use Compound Interest To Your Advantage</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been following the content to this point, you must have realized how simple the concept is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As simple as it sounds, it can make or mar your wealth-building strategy if you are not aware of how to apply it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take full advantage of compounding, you have to invest early. As this helps increase your tenor (time horizon).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be very detailed about borrowing loans. It is key to steer clear of loans whose interest compounds. One of such is a credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While navigating your investment options, be open to discussions around rates and compounding frequencies. These are going to work to your advantage in the long run.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Albert Einstein called compounding interest the eight wonders of the world, he was sure of what he was saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly successful investors have used this concept to build wealth over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your turn to do the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the peculiarity of the asset type you are investing in helps do quality research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good research of these asset classes will help you determine what percentage of your capital goes into what and why.  </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>5 Asset Classes to Invest your Money in Nigeria</b></h2>
<p><b>1. Equities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying and selling stocks could be a great way to increase or build wealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors with medium-to-high risk appetites play heavily with this asset. Its price volatility is a risk factor that needs astute management to achieve the desired result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equities are proven ways to grow capital and get dividends (for dividend-paying shares). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two great approaches to investing in this space are having a hang of fundamental and technical analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These analyses help determine what stock to buy and what time to buy it. Also, what stocks to sell and when to sell them. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Bonds</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capital market has varieties of diverse bonds at every period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds have different coupon rates and prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For bonds, you typically get paid coupons bi-annually. The coupon is calculated using the coupon rate and your face value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For investors that are particular about having a steady income from their investments, this is a go-to asset class for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few types of bonds, and each one has different characteristics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal government bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sukuk bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private bonds</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For bonds, you can have gains on capital when you decide not to hold to maturity. Otherwise, you get your streams of coupons. And get paid your face value upon maturity of the bond. </span></p>
<p><b>3. Mutual Funds</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a pool of funds managed by professionals to access varieties of money and capital market instruments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This form of investment does not necessarily require you to do a lot of research. The mutual fund&#8217;s managers will do that extensively for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you have to do is invest in the funds and get daily returns on your money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relevant things to bear in mind are management fees and performance over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make research on the fund managers and get a good idea of the previous performances of the fund in question before you start your investment journey. </span></p>
<p><b>4. Real Estate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landed properties are mostly appreciable in this economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in real estate comes with its own risk and liquidity problems. That&#8217;s why it is best suited for an investor looking to diversify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different angles to real estate investments. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy and sell land/properties at a later period</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial and residential properties </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">REITs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing robust research is pertinent to success in investing in this asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also be capital intensive. </span></p>
<p><b>5. Term Deposit</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simple investment vehicles in the market is the term deposit. Often referred to as Fixed Deposits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It requires you to fix your capital (or funds) with a firm with a predetermined interest rate and maturity date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an easy way to invest. In most cases, it&#8217;s relatively safe to some extent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-risk investors play heavily in this space. </span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you have it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other assets available in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are bills, CP, Structured notes, and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to give you a headstart on the best places to start investing your money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to be a guru to get started with any of the above-listed assets. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your investment success is not going to come cheap. You will have to <strong>work for it</strong> and earn it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you might have heard, investing is serious work that you have to be willing to get ready for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to get you worked up, think of investment as a skill. You will agree that no great skill expertise comes cheap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article is to help you get started with<strong> understanding core investment concepts</strong> that will help you make better investment decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>Initial Capital</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name implies, it is the first fund you use to start an investment. Your initial capital can be any amount as long as it conforms with the minimum capital requirement for the asset class you are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the capital market, different asset classes have ranges of initial capital. The starting capital for an equity investor is different from that of a fixed income inclined client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, there are firms that have tried to democratize investment by reducing the initial capital for most of these asset classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More capital means more opportunities to invest. And the higher your returns or losses.</span></p>
<h3><b>Liquidity Management</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is king! It is one catchy phrase constantly used in the investment world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity means the cash available for use at any period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps to have a strategy around liquidity management as an individual. It makes it easier for you to access new investment opportunities without selling off the previous ones untimely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no definite rule for the percentage of cash you can have in your portfolio. But, savvy investment professionals have 10 &#8211; 20% cash in their portfolio.</span></p>
<h3><b>Portfolio Diversification</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every asset type comes with its risk and return. Understanding how to have a balanced portfolio of assets needs a good understanding of individual risk and returns and how to combine them effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversifying your portfolio could help you in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to more investment opportunities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces portfolio volatility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigates losses due to a bull run in a particular market</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize your positions during market cycles</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversification is broad, but you can always start by having a couple of assets that play different roles in your portfolio.</span></p>
<h3><b>Compound Interest</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple interest, as you know, is the monetary privilege calculated on the principal lent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simpler terms, it is the benefit an investor derives from lending out their capital (fund) to invest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compound interest is the interest accrued by your interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s derived from the initial capital (principal) and the accumulated interests from previous periods. It is a faster way to grow your principal when compared to simple interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more frequent the interest compounds, the better the growth rate of the principal invested.</span></p>
<h3>
<b>Inflation-Adjusted Return</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental goal of all investors is to make money or build wealth. It is why investments are either for capital growth or steady income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever one you aligned with, return is important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you measure your success with the economic situation of Nigeria?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One smart way to do this is to always think of the effect of inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation is the general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money &#8211; Oxford Dictionary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your return on investment is affected by the economic condition of the country. To get the purchasing value of your return on investment, adjusting for inflation becomes key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also be called the real rate of return.</span></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These simple concepts of investing will help you get better at investing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding each of these concepts and applying them on your way to building wealth will be impactful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you are just starting with your investment journey, it is relevant that you have a plan around what you want to achieve and how you plan to do so within the scope of time you set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The baby steps are most times the core step in investment. It is the period when you take action with the final results in mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>Understand The Market and What Works</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not follow naysay and the crowd in the market. There are tons of concepts to get you started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, it is relevant to know what kind of investor you are and how to use this to your advantage. Are you risk-averse or risk-tolerant?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you biased to some asset classes due to their volatility or liquidity?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your strategy should take your personality into cognizance. it must consider:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your risk appetite</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your knowledge of the capital and money market</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset classes affinity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment focus (capital growth or income generation)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having all these in mind while building your strategy is great for clarity.</span></p>
<h3><b>Have a Long Term Approach</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions and wrong advice are great ways to fall short in your investment journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a long-term orientation around investments as the market will always throw the good, the bad, and the ugly at your face. Your long-term focus will be your best ally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build your portfolio for the long term and be guided about investment decisions based solely on emotional triggers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment is a never-ending learning phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best investors always stay open-minded. Being open-minded is the key to finding investment opportunities that aid your journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is robust, and the resources are enormous. Continuous learning will help you navigate the bends and curves of the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you are at it, do not forget that it is a long run.</span></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing is not a child’s play. Taking calculated risks with your capital is one of the scariest things to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As scary as it sounds, succeeding changes your life entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get started, learn the rudiments, apply what you have learned, and do not let your emotions decide for you. Also, always look for investment opportunities in sync with your personality and goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go out there and build a formidable portfolio for yourself.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergencies are situations whose occurrence is beyond our control. Solving these situations mostly requires money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not having an emergency fund/plan to fall back on can have a dire effect on your <strong>investment</strong>. And in difficult situations, it can lead you back into the debt cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To navigate these horrendous situations, it is relevant that you understand the concept of <strong>emergency funds</strong> and their importance.</span></p>
<p><b>What Is An Emergency Fund?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is King is not a myth!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An emergency fund is a fund kept solely for emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These emergencies can range from:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unforeseen Medical obligations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major Car repairs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having funds designated to solve these enormous unexpected expenses gives your investment journey a smoother ride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is best to invest in an interest-bearing savings account that is easily accessible. One of the characteristics of an emergency fund is its accessibility &#8211; it has to be available at every period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are money market mutual funds that make your funds available when you need them. Investing a part of your emergency funds in these mutual funds is not a bad idea, you enjoy higher interest on the funds and can also access it when emergencies beckon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know what an emergency fund is, let’s dive into why you need to have it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>3 Important Reasons for Emergency Fund</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Unexpected Medical Issues</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good health is paramount to the success of your investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When unexpected medical emergencies happen, it does cripple the focus of your investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you are so focused on your investment journey that you are not interested in building emergency funds. You have most of your funds in different asset classes &#8211; liquid and illiquid. If medical emergencies creep in, you tend to liquidate your funds from these asset classes. You bear pre-liquidation charges for or worse scenario, forced to sell at a loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sorts of emergencies, especially when they are recurring, are best tackled with emergency funds. It takes away the worries around liquidating your investment at the wrong time.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Building Target Savings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to stay afloat is upping your savings game. A disciplined way to do that is to have target savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do emergency funds help you with that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are emergencies, the first point of call is to dip inside your savings and solve this financial problem. But, when you have emergency funds, your savings are not disturbed as you only have to take from the emergency funds and sort the bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives you the peace of mind you need and the encouragement to keep up with your target savings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Loan Repayment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a loan you are servicing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you worried about what will happen to your financial wellbeing if an emergency creeps in while you are servicing this loan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your worries are justifiable!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency funds are here to your rescue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not having an emergency fund while servicing your debt can cause financial issues that could throw you into a debt cycle. You tend to borrow more to solve these emergencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, emergency funds seem like another financial or investment jargon. Taking your time through the content of this article, you have realized how it plays a relevant role in ensuring your investment plans are intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be investment savvy, building an emergency fund is a must.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having some funds to solve problems without distorting your investments in other asset classes is key to achieving the level of financial astuteness you want to attain.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your quest for <strong>financial freedom</strong>, one of the fundamentals is savings. You reach mastery level in savings through discipline and tenacity of purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This discipline you have built over your course of saving mony will in no small way help you navigate the hurdles of investment and creating wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While saving money is excellent, the investment ecosystem changes quickly, building solid capital through savings is noble. And the best way to do that is to save faster than an average person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article looks at tips that help you save money faster and more efficiently.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>10 Sure Tips To Save Money Faster</b></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Understand Your Finances</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At every stage of your life, your financial state differs. To build your savings as fast as you want to, you must understand your finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your finances means having a good grasp of your income, financial obligations, expenses, and financial goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It invariably helps you understand where you are at every period of your investment journey to freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. Don’t Be Afraid To Start Small.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to save is to take out what you can afford to save right now. So many people are stuck in the frenzy of saving money at their convenience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start from any amount you can do away with and grow your funds from there. Waiting till you are more comfortable will only complicate your savings plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Automate Your savings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the influx of FinTech in the financial ecosystem, your savings do not necessarily have to be as crude as it was years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You only need to come with the amount and time intervals you want. These fintech apps will do the rest and ensure that you can save your money with no hassle or problem of forgetting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. Automate your Bills</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automating your savings is a great thing, but very relevant automation to your savings journey is automating your bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a system or app that helps you deduct your bills from your account monthly will help you keep track of what is relevant and whatnot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reduces waste and increases extra funds for your savings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. Always Have a Budget</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All financial experts agree that the best way to control your investment journey is to have a solid budget for your money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This budget considers your income, bills, expenditures, debt servicing, savings, and other relevant use of your money. A solid budget does not need a complex formula or complicated model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need is a simple excel worksheet that helps you track your money habits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. Reduce your Grocery Spendings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to have more money for your savings is to cut back on recurring expenses. One of such expenses is your grocery spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much do you spend on groceries? Which of these groceries are not important? How much can you cut back from this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are questions that will give you pointers to what you need to remove from the list of groceries. Once you cut back on it, you have extra cash for your savings.</span></p>
<p><b>7. Cancel Unused Subscription</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is not a valuable subscription, cancel it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule of thumb is to subscribe when you need to use the service. Doing otherwise is not a smart financial move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscriptions have a way of creeping into your money and time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate all your recurring subscriptions and cancel those whose value is not clear or suitable for you at the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8. Improve Your Earning Power</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save more, you need to have more; and to have more, you need to earn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concentrating so much on cutting back on your expenses might not be the best way to increase your ability to save more and faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you thought about improving your earning power?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One sure way to do that is by improving your skills and expertise in a high-income space. Doing this will invariably position you better to earn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certifications, training, changing jobs, and others are relevant ways to improve your income.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. Have a Side Hustle</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from building your competence and skills on the job, another sure way to improve your income is to have a side hustle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A side hustle could be a business of some sort. It helps you get extra income for your savings goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you build this side hustle, you are also leaning towards investing in a business that would improve your income. The success of this hustle could be the tipping point for your investment journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>10. Splurge When You Can</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about taking care of yourself while trying to save faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy the good things of life too! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have worked so hard, time to have a taste of the goodies as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take yourself to a treat &#8211; enjoy good foods and a great ambiance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are wondering how this helps your investment journey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save more and faster, you need to have a clear head and have a taste of what you will enjoy when you are financially stable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splurge once in a while. But, be sure you can afford it!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving money is not as tedious as it seems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You only have to be disciplined and dedicated to what you are saving for and why it is relevant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving your goals; understanding your expenses, cutting back on expenditure, enjoying the fruits of your work, and building a budget are tips that increase your savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always remember that the goal is not to save. Savings help you build capital that makes it easy to get <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/investments/">investment</a> opportunities that improve your chances of financial freedom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever been in a lot of debt that the mere thought of it causes you to lose sleep?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you feel overwhelmed trying to wrap your head around the possible way to offset these bad debts you have been carrying for some period?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you tried borrowing again and declined because no one trusts that you can pay back?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are not alone in this mystery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article is to assist you in understanding how to borrow (personal loan) responsibly without hurting yourself or your lender in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin.</span></p>
<p><b>Understand Financial Leveraging And When To Use It</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin with the fundamentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you understand by the term ‘Financial Leveraging’?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leverage is the use of debt (borrowed capital) to undertake investment or project. The result is to multiply the potential returns from a project.” &#8211; Investopedia</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply, financial leveraging is using borrowed funds for purposes with monetary benefits. Look at it this way, borrowing a loan with a monthly interest of 5% and using the fund for an investment that yields 7% monthly is a solid deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a net profit of 2% after taking out the cost of getting the funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding this concept equips you with good knowledge of what to use borrowed funds for and how best to sweat the funds. I know you still wonder how this concerns you because you borrow to sort domestic problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, that is one of the problems. It is intelligent to <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/loans/">borrow loans</a> for situations that are a bit above just domestic issues.</span></p>
<p><b>Always Keep Your Credit Scores Clean</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot overemphasize this enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your credit score is your personality!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is what people see when they see you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the exact thing a firm sees when you apply to borrow from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s play out a scenario so you understand this as simply as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you have a friend with the name Peter. Peter came to borrow some funds from you last year, and he is yet to refund you. He is not even saying anything about it. You have asked him severally, but he kept dodging you at every corner. You have even moved on and accepted this as your cross. Sad!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long story short, Peter sent you a message that he needs urgent funds to sort his rent. What is the first thing that comes to your mind?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ooooh! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I am correct, do you remember the last one he came to collect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except you are swimming in money, it would be tough to give out your hard-earned to a friend who never pays you back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is how firms see you if you do not keep your credit score in great shape. And that all loan firms have this information is more reason to take it seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliberately keeping your credit score healthy will spur you to repay loans when due. This way, you can sleep with your eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reiterate, accessing funds when you need them is not the problem here, and not coming through with your repayment is where you start to sink into debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand the leveraging and how best to use it to your advantage and unapologetically build your credit score, you are not going to have a sleepless night worrying about loans repayment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you put these two secrets into practice, you are definitely on your way to a responsible borrowing lifestyle.</span></p>

You will have to <strong>work for it<\/strong> and earn it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you might have heard, investing is serious work that you have to be willing to get ready for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to get you worked up, think of investment as a skill. You will agree that no great skill expertise comes cheap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article is to help you get started with<strong> understanding core investment concepts<\/strong> that will help you make better investment decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Initial Capital<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name implies, it is the first fund you use to start an investment. Your initial capital can be any amount as long as it conforms with the minimum capital requirement for the asset class you are buying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the capital market, different asset classes have ranges of initial capital. The starting capital for an equity investor is different from that of a fixed income inclined client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although, there are firms that have tried to democratize investment by reducing the initial capital for most of these asset classes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More capital means more opportunities to invest. And the higher your returns or losses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Liquidity Management<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash is king! It is one catchy phrase constantly used in the investment world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquidity means the cash available for use at any period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps to have a strategy around liquidity management as an individual. It makes it easier for you to access new investment opportunities without selling off the previous ones untimely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no definite rule for the percentage of cash you can have in your portfolio. But, savvy investment professionals have 10 &#8211; 20% cash in their portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Portfolio Diversification<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every asset type comes with its risk and return. Understanding how to have a balanced portfolio of assets needs a good understanding of individual risk and returns and how to combine them effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversifying your portfolio could help you in the following ways:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exposure to more investment opportunities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduces portfolio volatility<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitigates losses due to a bull run in a particular market<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize your positions during market cycles<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversification is broad, but you can always start by having a couple of assets that play different roles in your portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Compound Interest<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple interest, as you know, is the monetary privilege calculated on the principal lent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simpler terms, it is the benefit an investor derives from lending out their capital (fund) to invest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compound interest is the interest accrued by your interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s derived from the initial capital (principal) and the accumulated interests from previous periods. It is a faster way to grow your principal when compared to simple interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more frequent the interest compounds, the better the growth rate of the principal invested.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\n<b>Inflation-Adjusted Return<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fundamental goal of all investors is to make money or build wealth. It is why investments are either for capital growth or steady income.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whichever one you aligned with, return is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you measure your success with the economic situation of Nigeria?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One smart way to do this is to always think of the effect of inflation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflation is the general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money &#8211; Oxford Dictionary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your return on investment is affected by the economic condition of the country. To get the purchasing value of your return on investment, adjusting for inflation becomes key.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could also be called the real rate of return.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These simple concepts of investing will help you get better at investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding each of these concepts and applying them on your way to building wealth will be impactful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your investment success is not going to come cheap.

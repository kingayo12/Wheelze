One minute, you have everything figured out. The next minute, you are struggling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people who opt to take loans are financially savvy individuals who need to sort unexpected expenses or use funds for urgent investment purposes. It is contrary to the general notion that borrowers are not financially astute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To exhibit true financial smartness, it has become important to carry out due diligence on the loan firm before accepting to do business together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a lot of loan firms also comes with its cons &#8211; some firms disguised their mediocrity and unprofessionalism.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>What are the five(5) things to consider when choosing a loan firm?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does not matter if it is your first or tenth time accessing loans. The insight below would help you make better decisions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1. The Company&#8217;s Credibility<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most important of this list. You have to distinguish between the real players in that space and the wannabes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It means that you have to confirm the existence of the firm. The reviews from other customers. How long they have been in the business and how successful they have been over that period.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are they a registered company?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they have an office address?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have they been in the news for the wrong reasons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answers to all these questions will help you form a concrete credibility scorecard for the firm. It would inevitably help you make solid decisions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Service Delivery<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great companies who create suitable solutions for clients are always intentional with their service delivery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before accepting to do business with that loan firm, one of the things to confirm is how well they treat customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How well do they respond to inquiries?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How quick is their complaints resolution?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you access their products online?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are they active on social media platforms?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they have walk-in customers, are they courteous or indifferent in their approach?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these give you an insight into how they will treat you when you agree to be their customers. Reviews are one great way to see what other people are saying about the brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Data Privacy &amp; Confidentiality<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During KYC, loan firms ask for relevant questions to enable them to profile you accordingly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you confident that the information you provided is safe with them?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you guaranteed that the details of your transactions are secured?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have to be worried about data leakage?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is significant!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are cases of loan firms sending nasty messages to friends and families of their customers &#8211; labeling them all sorts of names.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sure you do not want to fall into this disheartening situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4. Interest Rates<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way <a href=\"https:\/\/fundquestnigeria.com\">loan firms<\/a> compete in the market is with rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a client, shopping for the best rate is excellent. Knowing the cost of the funds you are accessing is a no-brainer in this space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interest rate is the extra you pay for the loan. A firm considers several things before a firm puts up an interest rate. Creditworthiness and income are a couple.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lower the rate, the better it is. And, do not make decisions solely on the interest rates as this could be incomplete research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>5. Repayment Flexibility<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Income and expenditures go a long way in determining your financial capacity. Your financial capacity is key in debt servicing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real work is not in getting the loan. It is in repaying the loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not go ahead with that loan without knowing their repayment structure? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does it align with your financial capacity? If not, are they willing to restructure it to fit your purse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answers to these questions are relevant as they will guide you aright so you will not make a rash financial decision. As much as getting the loan is elating, your ability to pay it back without hurting your financial wellbeing is crucial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not be scared of having a conversation with the firm before opting for their service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At times, a better tenor is all you need to help you fit the repayment very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>CONCLUSION\/SUMMARY<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There you have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial shrewdness is not magic. It is knowing and doing what works for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do proper research before opting for that firm&#8217;s loan &#8211; your financial wellbeing and peace of mind are crucial.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Situations of life are unpredictable, especially when it comes to finances.

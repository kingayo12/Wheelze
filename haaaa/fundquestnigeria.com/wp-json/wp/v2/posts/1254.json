Yours truly is single again\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes\u2026 that happened. Yeah, before your curiosity comes all dashing for me though, I\u2019ll tell you everything, every single thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the new year started out quite promising for yours truly; I had all I needed, and a little bit of what I wanted too. A comfortable apartment; a great job I loved; a charming boyfriend\u2026 err, well let\u2019s not call his name now for reasons you know already\u2026; and a wonderful financial partner in Fund Quest. One could say year 2021 couldn\u2019t have started better dear diary, or so I thought anyway. Until February the month of love came rolling by\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>February brought with it the atmosphere of love; everywhere you turned there were cuddles, teddy bears, chocolates and red roses. Now I am not exactly a petty person dear diary, neither am I demanding but I am still a babe that needs TLC, you know Tender \u2013 Loving \u2013 Care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 14<sup>th<\/sup>, the famed day of love, my doorbell rang, I certainly did expect more than I met with. I opened that door dear diary, and behold <em>Olumide <\/em>was standing there, smiling sheepishly, his arms spread in front of him holding nothing, expecting an embrace from <em>\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u201d <\/em>definitely not me, the whole butterflies in my stomach died a sudden death. And then he was bold enough to say\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHello darling.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Me:<\/strong> Ignores his outstretched hands and peers behind him<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Olumide:<\/strong>  Looks behind him to confirm what I am looking at, and sees nothing. Turns back to me confused, arms still held aloft.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Me:<\/strong> Attempts to close the door again<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Olumide: <\/strong>Ohhhhh.. I see now. He starts laughing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But babe, you specifically told me not to get you anything. Your exact words if I remembered was, \u201cValentine is overrated, and love should be celebrated every day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Me:<\/strong> Looks at him perplexed, <strong>And you believed me?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh well, long story short dear diary, men are scum. I broke up with him the next day, or so I think anyway, and though he has been sending me gifts every day since then sha, I still haven\u2019t agreed to see him. Maybe I will in March, maybe not. As I said, I am not petty or demanding or anything o but Tender\u2013Loving \u2013 Care is important. The man singing #LoriIro might be right after all. Maybe I am just Olumide\u2019s tomato or rodo #LoriIro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least I got a text from FundQuest and a surprise gift on Valentine\u2019s day though. Maybe I will make FundQuest my new boyfriend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways, yours truly is single again dear diary, and till next time, that\u2019s the status quo. Meanwhile stay off men diary, because men are scum&#8230; I think\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary, I have big news, very big news.

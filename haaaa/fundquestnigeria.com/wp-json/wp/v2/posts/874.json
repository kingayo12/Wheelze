First, the novel Coronavirus began to spread more seriously within the country than before, with new cases announced almost every other day. Putting on the television set has become a painful act, with news of people dying from the disease around the world, while here in Nigeria it seems to come closer and closer to me each day. I have never been so scared diary. But I still have Olumide to lighten my mood though, or so I thought\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work has now been closed, as the state is now on lockdown. Everyone has been asked to stay indoors and avoid non-essential movement. My days are now extra long diary, and my nights have no end\u2026 In fact, I have been bored so silly that I have spent a whole day trying to figure out if going on a date constitutes essential movement or not\u2026 sigh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one good thing about this whole scenario diary, is that I get to chat more now with Olumide, even though a date is out of it for the time being. I have now learnt so much about him, as well as his FundQuest products (which he never stops yapping about by the way). I now know that apart from getting a salary advance loan for myself, I can also get a loan for my brother who is a contractor to service his purchase orders prior to payment, while my mum can get a working capital loan to expand her business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diary I think Olumide is a God sent. At least I\u2019m now fairly sure that this whole Coronavirus wahala will not ruin my family financially. But then Diary, the disease has to go soon nonetheless. I honestly wish everyone could stay Indoors, wash or sanitize their hands regularly, and avoid touching their faces as much as possible. Sigh..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days when you sneeze and they \u201cbless you\u201d for it\u2026 Now everyone simply run for their<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>dear life\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh dear diary\u2026 I miss work!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary, I miss work!

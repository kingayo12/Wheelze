It is your plan. The success or lack of it is yours to bear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, it is relevant to know what kind of investor you are and how to use this to your advantage. Are you risk-averse or risk-tolerant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you biased to some asset classes due to their volatility or liquidity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your strategy should take your personality into cognizance. it must consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your time horizon<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your risk appetite<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your knowledge of the capital and money market<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asset classes affinity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investment focus (capital growth or income generation)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having all these in mind while building your strategy is great for clarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Have a Long Term Approach<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotions and wrong advice are great ways to fall short in your investment journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a long-term orientation around investments as the market will always throw the good, the bad, and the ugly at your face. Your long-term focus will be your best ally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build your portfolio for the long term and be guided about investment decisions based solely on emotional triggers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Be Open-Minded<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investment is a never-ending learning phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best investors always stay open-minded.

Also, always look for investment opportunities in sync with your personality and goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go out there and build a formidable portfolio for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Success as an investor is not a walk in the park.

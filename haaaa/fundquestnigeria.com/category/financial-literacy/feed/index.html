										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Imagine a child holding the hands of a parent or older relative. Imagine crossing the road without having to look right or left. All a child requires is to trust the judgement of the guardian. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That is what </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">financial advisory</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> does. A financial advisor is a professional who offers financial advisory services for a fee agreed upon by both parties.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/advisory/">Financial advisor</a> takes certain responsibilities off your hands while you focus on other things like actually making money. It involves investment management, tax planning, estate planning, etc. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is easy to frown at the need to have a financial advisor. You may feel like you have your money without them in the first place, so why should they come in to advise you and get a percentage of your money?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The truth is that you can make your money from a particular field of endeavour and not know of opportunities in other areas where you can make more money. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, you might make money as a spare parts dealer without knowing that you can also do well in Real estate. A financial advisor sees these opportunities and positions you to benefit from them. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Their service helps you<strong> build wealth faster with lesser risk.</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The relevance of a financial advisor cannot be over-emphasized. Decisions around money are the fulcrum of a healthy financial status.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A healthy financial status is the bedrock of every business organization. It extends to industries, and by extension, to the economy as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pay for a financial advisory service can be based on commission, profit-percentage structure, or both. This is an incentive for them to look for good deals and opportunities for you as a client. In clearer terms, their income is tied to the success of your venture or investment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot of different professionals are also financial advisors. They include stockbrokers, insurance agents, investment managers, and anyone whose job it is to manage your money, tax or investment. Estate planners can also be categorized as financial advisors. The important factor here is that a financial advisor must provide advice on money matters.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot of different people can claim to offer financial advisory services. For example, an estate surveyor determines the value of your property based on its location and what facilities or amenities are available. The bottom line is always about what is in it for them and what’s in it for you in the long run. There is a lot to gain from having a financial advisor readily available. You can get the services of good ones at </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/advisory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">www.fundquestnigeria.com</span></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see money as your slave that can be sent on money-making errands, thats when you start to enjoy the fruits of your hard-earned funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing fully well that your slaves (Interests) could also serve as your money-making slave is another level of investment savviness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting interest from your capital is interesting. Getting additional interest from the initial interest on your capital is sweet in the pudding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will help you understand this concept in simple terms without the unnecessary ambiguities of financial terminologies.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Compound Interest in Simple Term</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of your money to make you money and that money to make you extra money is Compound Interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is simply reinvesting the addition of your initial capital and the interest generated on it over a period. This new addition is referred to as your new principal at the point of reinvesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reinvested capital also generates interest. And the process of adding and reinvesting is repeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repetition is known as the compounding frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When interest generates extra interest for you, that is compound interest.</span></p>
<h3><b>Simple Interest VS Compound Interest</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people are accustomed to simple interests. Simple interest calculation is the cost of borrowing or lending money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are borrowing a loan, you owe the interest. If you are investing, you earn it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, unlike compound interest, simple interest does not have any compounding effect. You only get paid your principal plus the interest agreed at maturity of the investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general terms, Compound Interest is a better and faster way to grow capital and build wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same vein, loans calculated in compound interest can be detrimental to you as a borrower. As the interest compounds, your debt increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the reasons why personal finance savvy people like you will always prefer their investment to have compound interest. And their loans are better off at simple interest calculations.</span></p>
<h4><b>Core Variables</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear investors, compound interests are not a stand-alone principle. Some factors and concepts play relevant roles in compounding.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Initial Capital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What is the amount you are starting with? Or how many loans are you accessing? Compounding is based on the initial capital you invest or borrow as the case may be.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Interest Rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The higher the rates, the more funds you earn.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tenor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Compounding is a long-term strategy. The longer the tenor, the more it compounds and this relates to your earnings over that period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Compounding Frequency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Interest compounds annually, bi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. The more frequent the compounding, the more you earn. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>How to Use Compound Interest To Your Advantage</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been following the content to this point, you must have realized how simple the concept is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As simple as it sounds, it can make or mar your wealth-building strategy if you are not aware of how to apply it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take full advantage of compounding, you have to invest early. As this helps increase your tenor (time horizon).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be very detailed about borrowing loans. It is key to steer clear of loans whose interest compounds. One of such is a credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While navigating your investment options, be open to discussions around rates and compounding frequencies. These are going to work to your advantage in the long run.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Albert Einstein called compounding interest the eight wonders of the world, he was sure of what he was saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly successful investors have used this concept to build wealth over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your turn to do the same.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To invest successfully, you need to understand what and why you invest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the peculiarity of the asset type you are investing in helps do quality research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good research of these asset classes will help you determine what percentage of your capital goes into what and why.  </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>5 Asset Classes to Invest your Money in Nigeria</b></h2>
<p><b>1. Equities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying and selling stocks could be a great way to increase or build wealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors with medium-to-high risk appetites play heavily with this asset. Its price volatility is a risk factor that needs astute management to achieve the desired result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equities are proven ways to grow capital and get dividends (for dividend-paying shares). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two great approaches to investing in this space are having a hang of fundamental and technical analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These analyses help determine what stock to buy and what time to buy it. Also, what stocks to sell and when to sell them. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Bonds</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capital market has varieties of diverse bonds at every period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds have different coupon rates and prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For bonds, you typically get paid coupons bi-annually. The coupon is calculated using the coupon rate and your face value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For investors that are particular about having a steady income from their investments, this is a go-to asset class for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few types of bonds, and each one has different characteristics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal government bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sukuk bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private bonds</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For bonds, you can have gains on capital when you decide not to hold to maturity. Otherwise, you get your streams of coupons. And get paid your face value upon maturity of the bond. </span></p>
<p><b>3. Mutual Funds</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a pool of funds managed by professionals to access varieties of money and capital market instruments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This form of investment does not necessarily require you to do a lot of research. The mutual fund&#8217;s managers will do that extensively for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you have to do is invest in the funds and get daily returns on your money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relevant things to bear in mind are management fees and performance over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make research on the fund managers and get a good idea of the previous performances of the fund in question before you start your investment journey. </span></p>
<p><b>4. Real Estate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landed properties are mostly appreciable in this economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in real estate comes with its own risk and liquidity problems. That&#8217;s why it is best suited for an investor looking to diversify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different angles to real estate investments. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy and sell land/properties at a later period</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial and residential properties </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">REITs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing robust research is pertinent to success in investing in this asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also be capital intensive. </span></p>
<p><b>5. Term Deposit</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simple investment vehicles in the market is the term deposit. Often referred to as Fixed Deposits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It requires you to fix your capital (or funds) with a firm with a predetermined interest rate and maturity date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an easy way to invest. In most cases, it&#8217;s relatively safe to some extent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-risk investors play heavily in this space. </span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you have it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other assets available in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are bills, CP, Structured notes, and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to give you a headstart on the best places to start investing your money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to be a guru to get started with any of the above-listed assets. </span></p>

<p>You must have heard so much about the need to invest, that you are tired of hearing it. The truth is, investment knowledge pays the best interest. Investment can be likened to seeds which when planted can yield more proceeds. The day you plant seed is not the same day you eat the fruit.</p>



<p>Farmers do not work all their lives to gather seeds without planting. No matter how much they have, their major success is not just in harvest but the ability to plant seeds and patiently wait for the proceeds which give them more returns. </p>



<p>The farmers proceeds multiplies when he makes them work for him and not just him working for them. Money is like the farmer&#8217;s seed; you get money when you offer your time and service but you can equally get more money when you let the money work while you devote your time and sacrifice into something else.</p>



<p>The big lie many have believed over the years is that investment can only be done when you get to a certain stage in life, those who hold on to this believe wait for that perfect day to invest which unfortunately may never come.</p>



<p><strong><em>The best time to invest was yesterday, the next best time is TODAY, and the worst time is tomorrow –</em> Randell Tiongson</strong></p>



<p>The key to the better life which you aspire is in that which you live now. Treat your money as a worker, if you have to work for it, let it work for you too. The best time to invest is now. </p>

<p>Do you know that the rewards of investing early far outweigh the benefits of starting later? This is the powerful force of <strong>accruing interest.</strong> On an average, people who invest at a young age are more likely to grow their wealth, become financially independent and reach retirement sooner. The first step in your journey to investing should be a strong financial education. It is never wise to make investments in financial products you do not understand or cannot explain.</p>



<p>Ade and Ola are colleagues who started working at age 20 and retired at 60, Ade started investing N50,000 monthly right from his first pay-check while Ola decides to hold on for ten years. Ola also invested N50,000 monthly from the age of 30.</p>



<p>At retirement, Ade had about double-digit difference on his returns despite the fact that there was only a N6 million difference in capital invested. That is the power of starting early.</p>



<p>With investing, it is not just the act but the habit you are building along the way. Postponed investment short-changes you in the long run. The sooner you invest, the more your money grows and no amount is too small to start.</p>



<p>At FundQuest, you can begin with N50,000 or more and grow your investment as your income increases overtime. We invest and manage your money in risk friendly portfolios to suit your needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start investing today with us today at FundQuest Financial Services Limited.</p>

<p><strong>1. Avoid the herd mentality</strong>The typical buyer&#8217;s decision is usually heavily influenced by the actions of his acquaintances, neighbors or relatives. Thus, if everybody around is investing, the tendency for potential investors is to do the same. But this strategy is bound to backfire in the long run.</p>



<p>Always avoid having the herd mentality if you do not want to lose your hard-earned money.<br><strong><em>&#8220;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful!&#8221;</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Warren Buffett</strong></p>



<p><strong>2. Take informed decision</strong><br>Investors generally go by the name of a company or the industry they belong to. However, proper research should always be undertaken before investing.</p>



<p><strong>3. Invest in business you understand</strong><br>Before investing in a company, you should have proper understanding of the company’s business and sector.</p>



<p><strong>4. Create a broad portfolio</strong><br>Diversification of portfolio across asset classes and instruments is key to earning optimum returns on investments. The level of diversification depends on each investor&#8217;s risk-taking capacity.</p>



<p><strong>5. Have realistic expectations</strong><br>There is nothing wrong with hoping for the &#8216;best&#8217; from your investments, but you could be heading for trouble if your financial goals are based on unrealistic assumptions.<br><br>Build your investment knowledge with the guide of professionals at FundQuest Financial Services Limited. We can make your money work for you while you improve your investment understanding.</p>

<p>Have you been investing for a while, yet each time you check your portfolio nothing seems to be happening? Growth seems so far or out of reach and it looks like you will be stuck in your present financial situation.</p>



<p>These could be some of the causes.</p>



<p><strong>You are depleting your investment: </strong>There might have been some financial constraint that warranted extra cash and without hesitation, you dipped your hands into your investment account. Such habits will hinder the growth of your investment. This is why we advise that you should create separate Saving and Investment accounts from your income. With this, you can spend from your saving while you allow your investment to grow.</p>



<p><strong>You are not investing enough:</strong> Devise a realistic formula that ensures you optimize investment from your income. You need to pay yourself first from your income but do also ensure that you create a balance between what you consume now and what you set aside for future consumption through your investment.</p>



<p><strong>Your investment remains static as your income grows:</strong> We advise you set aside a stipulated amount for investment but this amount should not be static as your income increases. The stated investment amount should be a percentage of your income and not a fixed amount. This will ensure that your investment amount is automatically adjusted with changing income levels. Always remember the saying that “you cannot keep doing the same thing and expect different results”.</p>



<p><strong>No defined goals: </strong>Investment should have actual plans or goals to meet, as nothing motivates better than a target. If you set goals for yourself (short term or long term), you will find yourself enthusiastically doing so much more with ease. Do you have financial goals for the next three to twelve months? How much do you need to set aside to achieve those goals? With such self-enquiries and decisions, your investment will definitely grow</p>

<p>What does it mean to be a Smart Money Person?<br>Smart Money People are big thinkers or calculated risk enthusiasts, who are up-to-date about the ever-dynamic financial market and the numerous opportunities therein.</p>



<p>They look far beyond “now” and all the immediate gratifications, thereby not only investing but also reinvesting their returns to enjoy the benefits of financial compounding.</p>



<p>Smart Money People do not dip into their investments at every little life instance but they rather work towards continuous building of their wealth or investment portfolio regardless of circumstances.</p>



<p>They also diversify their risks by investing in well expanded portfolios of assets across financial markets.</p>



<p>They are not in hurry to make ‘quick gains’ or some incredible returns but rather construct their investment portfolios carefully and watch their investments grow over time. In essence, they make money work for them rather than working for money.</p>



<p>Perhaps you need to ask yourself whether these descriptions represent your financial lifestyle. Are you a Smart Money Person? If the answer is no, then you may need to speak to one of our Financial Advisors today by clicking here.

<p>Money is an essential commodity used as a medium of exchange. While our daily needs can never be exhausted, we must bear in mind that the choices we made about our finances go a long way in determining our financial wellbeing. And one way to create a strong foundation for our financial health is by investing.</p>



<p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CONSIDER INVESTING?<br></strong>The essence of investing is to grow your financial fortune or assets so they increase in value over time. Through investing, you can plan for near term emergencies or future projects, thereby attaining financial freedom.</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, it is a good investment discipline to have a long-term horizon while building an investment plan for the future. According to Steve Bawa “Investors with the best returns were dead or had forgotten about their accounts”. Having a long-term view is likely the best way for most people to get the best investment returns.</p>



<p>It is very important to make the right choice of investment partner. Seek a readily accessible investment professional who takes your specific needs into consideration. You may look to FundQuest as such a partner, having been delivering tailored financial plans and strategies to individuals and businesses across diverse sectors in the Nigerian economy.</p>



<p>FundQuest prepare investment plans which are designed just to suit your specific investment character, including your return expectations. We are always there and ready to help in turning your money to more money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear Diary,</p>



<p>I have big news, very big news. Yours truly is single again…</p>



<p>Oh yes… that happened. Yeah, before your curiosity comes all dashing for me though, I’ll tell you everything, every single thing.</p>



<p>So, the new year started out quite promising for yours truly; I had all I needed, and a little bit of what I wanted too. A comfortable apartment; a great job I loved; a charming boyfriend… err, well let’s not call his name now for reasons you know already…; and a wonderful financial partner in Fund Quest. One could say year 2021 couldn’t have started better dear diary, or so I thought anyway. Until February the month of love came rolling by…</p>



<p>February brought with it the atmosphere of love; everywhere you turned there were cuddles, teddy bears, chocolates and red roses. Now I am not exactly a petty person dear diary, neither am I demanding but I am still a babe that needs TLC, you know Tender – Loving – Care.</p>



<p>On February 14<sup>th</sup>, the famed day of love, my doorbell rang, I certainly did expect more than I met with. I opened that door dear diary, and behold <em>Olumide </em>was standing there, smiling sheepishly, his arms spread in front of him holding nothing, expecting an embrace from <em>“I don’t know who” </em>definitely not me, the whole butterflies in my stomach died a sudden death. And then he was bold enough to say…</p>



<p>“Hello darling.”</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Ignores his outstretched hands and peers behind him</p>



<p><strong>Olumide:</strong>  Looks behind him to confirm what I am looking at, and sees nothing. Turns back to me confused, arms still held aloft. </p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Attempts to close the door again</p>



<p><strong>Olumide: </strong>Ohhhhh.. I see now. He starts laughing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But babe, you specifically told me not to get you anything. Your exact words if I remembered was, “Valentine is overrated, and love should be celebrated every day.”</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Looks at him perplexed, <strong>And you believed me?</strong></p>



<p>Oh well, long story short dear diary, men are scum. I broke up with him the next day, or so I think anyway, and though he has been sending me gifts every day since then sha, I still haven’t agreed to see him. Maybe I will in March, maybe not. As I said, I am not petty or demanding or anything o but Tender–Loving – Care is important. The man singing #LoriIro might be right after all. Maybe I am just Olumide’s tomato or rodo #LoriIro.</p>



<p>At least I got a text from FundQuest and a surprise gift on Valentine’s day though. Maybe I will make FundQuest my new boyfriend.</p>



<p>Anyways, yours truly is single again dear diary, and till next time, that’s the status quo. Meanwhile stay off men diary, because men are scum&#8230; I think…</p>

<p>Dear Diary,</p>



<p>Yeah, I know, I know. I didn’t keep to my words. I promised I’d be back soon the last time we spoke, but it’s been months already. I didn’t intend to go MIA anyway, but I guess the act itself outweighs the thought. So, I will try to act out my intentions next time.</p>



<p>First off, work as usual. Nothing new here, I’ve been very occupied as is the norm, and you know how it can get exhausting at times. But of course, gratitude over complaints. After all, 2020 wasn’t a good year for many with regards to jobs. But let’s not open that can of worms now.</p>



<p>On to the next, you know who (*blushes), Olumide. Dear Diary, our erstwhile aspiring boyfriend, after some serious effort, has now become an official boyfriend. Oh diary, the gist is plenty, but trust me, I’ll drop it in bits as the weeks progresses. Just know dear diary, that relationship is hard sha, but then so is being single, and as for yours truly, I have decided to choose my own hard. Lol, don’t judge me.</p>



<p>Moving on, the End-of-year Thanksgiving dinner is approaching, and guess who is hosting diary – me.&nbsp; True to form, it will be extraordinarily lavish this year. Especially considering the many hurdles we have all crossed in the last few months. If there’s anything this year has taught me, it’s that life is too short not to spend it with the people you love. So, I’ll be having close friends and family around, and of course our now official boo, Olumide, will be there too.&nbsp; It will cost me a lot of money though, putting together a gigantic dinner as such, plus I also need a wardrobe upgrade ahead of the new year. But then of course, I can easily get a <strong>Payday Loan</strong> from FundQuest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Payday Loan from FundQuest gives me the confidence to make bold moves like this without fear of going broke. You know they always come through for me whenever I need them and that’s why I always spread the good news whenever I have the opportunity. Oh dear, what would my financial life be without FundQuest? I don’t think I want to find out.</p>



<p>See you soon, and this time I mean it. (*Smiles)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>



<p>Today is democracy day, and I am excited.</p>



<p>It has been a slow week, especially at work, despite the fact that it was a four day week. If I did these diary sessions midweek dear diary, I wouldn’t have had anything for you this week. Luckily though, the weekend started on Thursday, and boy, do I have a story for you!<br>It was only last night, when the gist got to me. You see, I have this colleague at work, Miriam. Yeah, I told you about her last week. She was the one whose matter we couldn’t settle. About that matter, she did get a new phone. That however, is not the story today. Today is about how she made a bad investment decision.</p>



<p>So sometime early this year, Miriam had put some funds into a new investment company. She had told some of us about how profitable it was, and how they had promised her very high returns after six months. Truth be told diary, I was tempted at the time. Yours truly however, had decided not to invest. In truth, I really had no spare funds at the time.</p>



<p>Anyway, Miriam and I believe, a couple of her friends invested, and the wait began. Every new month they received an updated statement showing their funds with the firm, and every month they sang to our ears that we missed out on a gold mine. Fast-forward to Thursday dear diary, when funds were due for liquidation. Lo and behold, said firm had upped and vanished into thin air. Like they say these days dear diary, it ended in tears.<br>I bet now they waited and invested with FundQuest, just like me. I know my money is definitely safe, because I know FundQuest is a CBN licensed institution. It goes without saying that there is no way it ends in tears.<br>Dear diary, it is weekend and I am excited! Especially because this weekend is Olumide’s birthday<br>too! Don’t you worry diary, I will fill you in next week!</p>



<p>Happy Democracy day!</p>



<p>Goodnight</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>



<p>I have a story to tell today, and my story is in two phases.</p>



<p>First of all, my week was good. It was taxing no doubt, but good nonetheless. I saw Olumide three times this week, despite the curfew, and mildly restricted movement. I also managed to fit in a few exercises at home during the week. I guess I’m becoming more disciplined, or perhaps I’m just trying to make up for not staying dedicated to the #fundquestwalkchallenge. Either way, it was a good and quiet week for me on the home front. However dear diary, work this week was a different ball game altogether. Thus begins the first phase of my story.</p>



<p>My colleague, Miriam and I were out on a work trip early this week to inspect the site of a building being constructed by one of our clients in the mainland part of Lagos. While there, I engaged with the foreman in charge and Miriam moved about, laptop in hand, inspecting parts of the building. Dear diary that was when it happened.<br>Apparently one of the wooden staircases in the building premises was yet to be completely constructed, but then Miriam didn’t know, and she was walking towards it. To prevent her from proceeding in that direction, one of the construction staff called out. Meanwhile, Miriam had her headphones on, and was so engrossed in a phone conversation. The construction staff made an attempt to step in front of her, acting as a barrier. However, in his attempt he lost his own footing and ended up falling over himself and Miriam in the process. Now we saw that the staff in question wanted to help, but in the process he ended up causing what he intended to prevent. Biggest issue was that Miriam’s laptop was now broken, and there was still work to be done. Who was to blame? Dear diary, instead of work, na #TheMatter we start to settle be that.<br>At the end of the day, it was Olumide (my very own Yoruba demon) that proposed a solution. As usual, it was another FundQuest product that saved the day. Apparently Miriam could get a new laptop on lease, while she slowly and comfortably pay the cost of the purchase over time with only a very moderate interest. She also got a new iPhone too. Trust me dear diary, I jumped on the train. Guess who is now the owner of a brand new Samsung A70? Yeah, yours truly!<br>Dear diary, this brings me to the second phase of my story. Friday noon at work, while Miriam and I were busy flaunting our gadgets, that is how David, one of our colleagues said he wanted to see o. Two seconds later, everything burst! Now Miriam’s iPhone has a screen problem. Dear diary, na #TheMatter wey we dey settle be that.<br>Goodnight..</p>

<p>Dear diary,<br>It has been a very strange week indeed.</p>



<p>Work began again on Monday, and I wish I could say I was looking forward to it. Before you say anything diary, I know. I was the one complaining of being tired sitting at home, guilty as charged. But you see diary, as the D-day to get back to work drew closer I started developing cold feet, and I wished I could stay a bit more at home. Anyway, all that is in the past now. Monday saw yours truly go back into the world… and believe it dear diary, the world was different.</p>



<p>First off, everyone wore nose masks and it became quite difficult to tell who was who as I passed through familiar routes. I greeted a stranger enthusiastically believing her to be one of the staff in the office next to mine, and I totally ignored the ‘hellos’ of a senior colleague as I navigated my way through human traffic completely certain that he was a total stranger. That is, until I got to the office and I noticed the very same pattern on his suit, and I proceeded to apologize profusely. But dear diary, that was only the beginning…</p>



<p>Complying with the curfew was an entirely different ball game altogether. I found myself doing those running exercises I couldn’t keep up with during the lockdown, as I raced to meet up with commercial buses, and raced again to get home prior to 8pm. Who knew, I probably could have aced the #fundquestwalkchallenge which Olumide never stopped yapping about during the lockdown. I guess it is what it is anyway. Speaking of Olumide, the clincher for the week had everything to do with my Yoruba Demon…</p>



<p>Dear diary, it had promised to be an amazing Friday. I was to have a date with Olumide. I had even bought a new dress and put on some extra makeup, despite the necessity of my nose mask. Don’t look at me diary, Olumide is special. Who knows what I would have done in this lockdown if not for his Questmoney loans that helped me keep ends together. Anyway, we met at this fancy outdoor eatery, and dear diary, we hugged…</p>



<p>In hindsight it was risky, but diary, the wahala that came with that single hug will take two full diary sessions to talk about. Long story short sha, eatery asked us to leave; and a pamphlet carefully detailing the social distancing measures was handed to us. That was not it o. We were then subjected to a thorough process of hand sanitizing and social distancing lectures by health officials who lurked by. By the time we were free to focus on ourselves again, it was time to beat another 8pm curfew.</p>



<p>Dear diary, it was welcome to a brave new world post lockdown.</p>



<p>Let me kuku go and sanitize again before bed. It is well…</p>

<p>Dear Diary,</p>



<p>I know I have been gone so long! Forgive me…</p>



<p>As confusing as it may seem, I never actually left. Allow me to explain…</p>



<p>I did tell you about the lockdown the last time I wrote, and about how much I miss work. Oh diary, it hasn’t gotten any better, I still do miss work, and terribly too. I remember when the lockdown was first announced; oh how it had felt good knowing that I could sleep in for a couple more hours in the morning. For a while it had seemed like a long-delayed Utopia. In hindsight dear diary, maybe a little too much Utopia. Because I certainly now understand why they say too much of everything is bad.</p>



<p>I do admit though, that within then and now, I had a lot of free time and I could have said hello once or twice more than I did dear diary. But truth is, staying home from work isn’t</p>



<p>all it promises to be, especially since I had to go home and be with my family (yeah, I had to). I should probably let you in on one thing too diary, younger siblings are nothing if not juvenile terrorists! Aaaargh!</p>



<p>I did manage to get by with the kids after a few days however, in spite of their numerous and seemingly unending vices. But then another phase then somehow set in; the keeping up with expectation phase.</p>



<p>Now that I think back at it, I probably should have just ignored the hype at the time. But dear diary,&nbsp; with everyone now at home, and social media suddenly awash with keep fit goals, online courses, skills to develop during the lockdown, and what have you, I indelibly fell for the pressure, and suddenly I found myself taking multiple online courses (none of which I have yet finished), and exercises (none of which I have been able to regularly dedicate myself to either). But eventually diary, it all slowed down…</p>



<p>The days are all the same now diary. Yesterday is today, and today is tomorrow. There are no longer annoying Mondays, no slow Tuesdays, no thankful Fridays, no party weekends, no weekdays. There are just days now Diary, just slow boring days. I am not even sure of what to do with them anymore…</p>



<p>Bottom line diary, is I promise to see more of you as we now approach the easing phase of the lockdown. Next time I would gist you about how Olumide managed to almost break my heart recently, he is a Yoruba demon after all.</p>



<p>For now, goodnight Dear Diary.</p>

<p>Dear Diary, I miss work!</p>



<p>I cannot believe that I could ever one day utter these words, but dear diary, I really do miss a lot about the office… the tables, the chairs, the people… sigh…</p>



<p>It has been a sad week diary, one that has been littered with unhappy news. First, the novel Coronavirus began to spread more seriously within the country than before, with new cases announced almost every other day. Putting on the television set has become a painful act, with news of people dying from the disease around the world, while here in Nigeria it seems to come closer and closer to me each day. I have never been so scared diary. But I still have Olumide to lighten my mood though, or so I thought…</p>



<p>Work has now been closed, as the state is now on lockdown. Everyone has been asked to stay indoors and avoid non-essential movement. My days are now extra long diary, and my nights have no end… In fact, I have been bored so silly that I have spent a whole day trying to figure out if going on a date constitutes essential movement or not… sigh.</p>



<p>The one good thing about this whole scenario diary, is that I get to chat more now with Olumide, even though a date is out of it for the time being. I have now learnt so much about him, as well as his FundQuest products (which he never stops yapping about by the way). I now know that apart from getting a salary advance loan for myself, I can also get a loan for my brother who is a contractor to service his purchase orders prior to payment, while my mum can get a working capital loan to expand her business.</p>



<p>Diary I think Olumide is a God sent. At least I’m now fairly sure that this whole Coronavirus wahala will not ruin my family financially. But then Diary, the disease has to go soon nonetheless. I honestly wish everyone could stay Indoors, wash or sanitize their hands regularly, and avoid touching their faces as much as possible. Sigh..</p>

<p>Dear diary&#8230;</p>



<p>It has been a strange week. So much has happened that I cannot begin to talk about. But this week I learned a major lesson; Never trust get rich quick schemes. Remember Olumide? Our… sorry, my fine boy? He started my week with a disappointment. So you see, we spoke almost all weekend, and by Sunday evening we had agreed to meet by 6pm on Monday to get dinner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, fast-forward to 5pm on Monday he called me, only to say that he could not make it anymore. And when I asked why, he said; “<em>Babe, Corona Virus is spreading fast and it has led to oil price falling drastically. My boss needs me to work late today because of these developments.” </em>Haba! Aspiring boo, Kini o kan Corona ati oil price kan date wa ke? (What concerns Corona Virus and oil price with our date?). Anyway, I said okay, and decided on alternate plans for my evening. I cannot wear my favorite dress on Monday, only to use it at work. I have to flaunt it as well. And that was how I followed some of my colleagues to the mall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dear diary, in hindsight, I should have gone straight home… Because at the mall, one of my colleagues introduced me to a friend, who introduced me to another, who introduced me to a Ponzi scheme in which I could double my money in only 48 hours. Foolishly, oh dear diary, foolishly, yours truly gullibly bought into it. And with Joy’s money too. By Wednesday, I was still naively awaiting my doubled funds, only to be told by Thursday morning that the scheme had crashed. Aah! Olohun o ni je! (God will not allow it). Money that is not mine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dear diary, that was only the beginning. By noon on the same day, Joy called. She had found an apartment, and she needed the money she kept with me. Apparently, it was money she intended to use as rent. Dear diary, I was at a loss as to what to say. I simply told her I would call her back. See me, see trouble. I wanted to double my money, but instead I got double wahala.</p>



<p>Anyway, aspiring boo finally bailed me out. And ironically, it was another one of his QuestMoney products that saved the day, <em>sigh</em>. Who knew I could get a payday loan at low interest rate, no collateral, and in quick time too? Maybe our… sorry, my fine boy is not so disappointing after all. God knows I would have gotten an enforced roommate by now.</p>



<p>Dear diary, Thank God it’s Friday…</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>



<p>I have a dilemma. I’m sorry, I know this is not how I should start with you today, but it has been on my mind all week. So please understand…</p>



<p>So, I have been thinking about money again, as usual. Who doesn’t? Infact, it is almost the only thing I think about these days. Afterall, it was the first point in my six-point 2020 plan (since I don’t do resolutions). But since I made that plan, only one has been achieved Mr. Diary, and it is you. Since then, I have just been writing and writing and writing. No boyfriend, no promotion, no savings, infact, no nothing. Phew! And March is beginning to stroll by again, just like his brothers January and February before him.</p>



<p>Anyway, before I forget, I have a dilemma dear diary, and as you are still my only boyfriend for now, I have come to you. You see I met a guy during the week, one very fine smooth-talking guy. We took the same bus from Ajah to Obalende on my way to work, and we started talking. He said his name was Olumide, a Yoruba Devil, imagine! Long story short, he collected my number, and gave me his. But when this fine boy did call dear diary, instead of wooing me, you know what he did? He kept on asking me to come and start savings and investments with his company. Haba! All I was hearing from fine boy was QuestMoney, QuestMoney, QuestMoney. Dear diary, if not for savings being a very key part of my 2020 plan, I would have deleted his numb&#8230; but errm, he’s a fine boy though, so maybe I wouldn’t. Anyways, what do I do diary? He did say we should find a day to meet, and he also mentioned other interesting things like a 10% interest rate, and that I can start with as little as N50k&#8230;</p>



<p>Dear diary, should I start saving now? Can I? I still haven’t gotten that promotion like I expected&#8230; But diary he is a fine boy, and even if he hasn’t said anything, he can still be a prospect&#8230; and that is my dilemma. Diary, it is late… my eyes are closing…</p>



<p>And Joy did ive me some money to hold last week o&#8230; I think I would just saaaaaaa…</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>Zzz…</p>

<p><b>Why FundQuest remains value-driven, dependable credit and loan firm, by Akinjayeju</b></p>
<p>FundQuest is a CBN licensed financial institution that is currently in her 10th year of operation. We operate from Nigeria’s commercial hub, Lagos State and extend our services all around the country. I must say that it has been an extreme privilege for me to serve as the Managing Director/CEO of this great financial institution over the years, says Abiodun Akinjayeju.</p>
<p>Since inception, FundQuest has been operating within the mid-tier of the Nigerian financial system, offering <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/loans/">Loans</a>, <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/leases/">Leases</a>, <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/investments/">Investments</a>, <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/investments/">Funds Management</a>, and <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/advisory/">Financial Advisory Services</a> to customers across all sectors of the economy. Our loan products have been centered around tailor made funding to registered Small and Medium Enterprises that have been in operation for at least one year. While our investment offering boasts of competitive interest rate with better returns on investment with greater flexibility for investors to access their funds than most of our competitors.</p>
<p>FundQuest has been a dependable organization (i.e. easily approachable) in this last decade, offering Funding and Financing Solutions which has added immense value to individual and MSME growth in Nigeria in a much differentiated FundQuest.  We also intend to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>2020 was a year that took the world by surprise with the global outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic shutting down world economy for months, and Nigeria was no exception. Whilst this period was filled with uncertainty, FundQuest was there in a measured and reassured way for our customers and provided our support during this turbulent period. Several clients were offered payment moratorium, interest rate concession, loan restructuring, reduced interest/charges on new loans, and free business advisory on how to navigate through the challenges associated with Covid-19. We also educated our clients on the need to have a realistic business-continuity plan and solid corporate governance structure in preparation for any future uncertainties.</p>
<p>Industries and businesses do come with their challenges, but the pertinent issues facing the financial services industry among others is ascertaining credit worthiness of clients with reliable adequate data. FundQuest has been able to work rigorously to a large extent through expertise within the organization in analysing their suitability in meeting the expectations of our clients despite the challenges on adequate data needed.</p>
<p>Apart from the varieties of products we offer to our clients, we also offer business advisory on how their businesses can grow in leaps, when and how funds can be secured and we take them by the hands to succeed in their businesses. We are intentional in doing these because granting credit to our client is not only our focus; giving business advises to help them grow makes us a better organization to partner with. This is an added value which sets us apart as an organisation.</p>
<p>Strategically, the Board of FundQuest has been able to bring in more investors to the organization as a result of our past performances which shows that we are forward-thinking in growing our business capital so that many more MSMEs and individuals would be reached and can partner with our services. This will also help to situate FundQuest as a key player in the credit space within the financial sector.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we at FundQuest (<a href="http://www.fundquestnigeria.com/">www.fundquestnigeria.com</a>) can say that adding value to our clients and MSMEs in general has not been a fluke. In the recent rise of so many loan sharks and fraudulent institutions cashing out on the gullible masses, it has been a deliberate act for FundQuest both strategically and in terms of routine operations, to uphold our mandates of being the best at what we do and we have been at this for almost a decade and counting.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge that adding value flows both ways, that is why we ensure that adequate feedbacks from all quarters (Clients, Regulators, Stakeholders etc.) are taken into consideration in order to always be better and surpasses all expectations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see money as your slave that can be sent on money-making errands, thats when you start to enjoy the fruits of your hard-earned funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing fully well that your slaves (Interests) could also serve as your money-making slave is another level of investment savviness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting interest from your capital is interesting. Getting additional interest from the initial interest on your capital is sweet in the pudding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will help you understand this concept in simple terms without the unnecessary ambiguities of financial terminologies.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Compound Interest in Simple Term</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of your money to make you money and that money to make you extra money is Compound Interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is simply reinvesting the addition of your initial capital and the interest generated on it over a period. This new addition is referred to as your new principal at the point of reinvesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reinvested capital also generates interest. And the process of adding and reinvesting is repeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repetition is known as the compounding frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When interest generates extra interest for you, that is compound interest.</span></p>
<h3><b>Simple Interest VS Compound Interest</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people are accustomed to simple interests. Simple interest calculation is the cost of borrowing or lending money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are borrowing a loan, you owe the interest. If you are investing, you earn it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, unlike compound interest, simple interest does not have any compounding effect. You only get paid your principal plus the interest agreed at maturity of the investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general terms, Compound Interest is a better and faster way to grow capital and build wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same vein, loans calculated in compound interest can be detrimental to you as a borrower. As the interest compounds, your debt increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the reasons why personal finance savvy people like you will always prefer their investment to have compound interest. And their loans are better off at simple interest calculations.</span></p>
<h4><b>Core Variables</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear investors, compound interests are not a stand-alone principle. Some factors and concepts play relevant roles in compounding.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Initial Capital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What is the amount you are starting with? Or how many loans are you accessing? Compounding is based on the initial capital you invest or borrow as the case may be.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Interest Rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The higher the rates, the more funds you earn.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tenor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Compounding is a long-term strategy. The longer the tenor, the more it compounds and this relates to your earnings over that period.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Compounding Frequency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Interest compounds annually, bi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. The more frequent the compounding, the more you earn. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>How to Use Compound Interest To Your Advantage</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been following the content to this point, you must have realized how simple the concept is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As simple as it sounds, it can make or mar your wealth-building strategy if you are not aware of how to apply it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take full advantage of compounding, you have to invest early. As this helps increase your tenor (time horizon).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be very detailed about borrowing loans. It is key to steer clear of loans whose interest compounds. One of such is a credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While navigating your investment options, be open to discussions around rates and compounding frequencies. These are going to work to your advantage in the long run.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Albert Einstein called compounding interest the eight wonders of the world, he was sure of what he was saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly successful investors have used this concept to build wealth over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your turn to do the same.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To invest successfully, you need to understand what and why you invest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the peculiarity of the asset type you are investing in helps do quality research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good research of these asset classes will help you determine what percentage of your capital goes into what and why.  </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>5 Asset Classes to Invest your Money in Nigeria</b></h2>
<p><b>1. Equities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying and selling stocks could be a great way to increase or build wealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors with medium-to-high risk appetites play heavily with this asset. Its price volatility is a risk factor that needs astute management to achieve the desired result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equities are proven ways to grow capital and get dividends (for dividend-paying shares). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two great approaches to investing in this space are having a hang of fundamental and technical analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These analyses help determine what stock to buy and what time to buy it. Also, what stocks to sell and when to sell them. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Bonds</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capital market has varieties of diverse bonds at every period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds have different coupon rates and prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For bonds, you typically get paid coupons bi-annually. The coupon is calculated using the coupon rate and your face value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For investors that are particular about having a steady income from their investments, this is a go-to asset class for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few types of bonds, and each one has different characteristics</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal government bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sukuk bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private bonds</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For bonds, you can have gains on capital when you decide not to hold to maturity. Otherwise, you get your streams of coupons. And get paid your face value upon maturity of the bond. </span></p>
<p><b>3. Mutual Funds</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a pool of funds managed by professionals to access varieties of money and capital market instruments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This form of investment does not necessarily require you to do a lot of research. The mutual fund&#8217;s managers will do that extensively for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you have to do is invest in the funds and get daily returns on your money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relevant things to bear in mind are management fees and performance over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make research on the fund managers and get a good idea of the previous performances of the fund in question before you start your investment journey. </span></p>
<p><b>4. Real Estate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landed properties are mostly appreciable in this economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in real estate comes with its own risk and liquidity problems. That&#8217;s why it is best suited for an investor looking to diversify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different angles to real estate investments. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy and sell land/properties at a later period</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial and residential properties </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">REITs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing robust research is pertinent to success in investing in this asset class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also be capital intensive. </span></p>
<p><b>5. Term Deposit</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simple investment vehicles in the market is the term deposit. Often referred to as Fixed Deposits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It requires you to fix your capital (or funds) with a firm with a predetermined interest rate and maturity date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an easy way to invest. In most cases, it&#8217;s relatively safe to some extent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-risk investors play heavily in this space. </span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you have it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other assets available in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are bills, CP, Structured notes, and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to give you a headstart on the best places to start investing your money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to be a guru to get started with any of the above-listed assets. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergencies are situations whose occurrence is beyond our control. Solving these situations mostly requires money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not having an emergency fund/plan to fall back on can have a dire effect on your <strong>investment</strong>. And in difficult situations, it can lead you back into the debt cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To navigate these horrendous situations, it is relevant that you understand the concept of <strong>emergency funds</strong> and their importance.</span></p>
<p><b>What Is An Emergency Fund?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is King is not a myth!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An emergency fund is a fund kept solely for emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These emergencies can range from:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unforeseen Medical obligations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major Car repairs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having funds designated to solve these enormous unexpected expenses gives your investment journey a smoother ride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is best to invest in an interest-bearing savings account that is easily accessible. One of the characteristics of an emergency fund is its accessibility &#8211; it has to be available at every period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are money market mutual funds that make your funds available when you need them. Investing a part of your emergency funds in these mutual funds is not a bad idea, you enjoy higher interest on the funds and can also access it when emergencies beckon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know what an emergency fund is, let’s dive into why you need to have it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>3 Important Reasons for Emergency Fund</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Unexpected Medical Issues</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good health is paramount to the success of your investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When unexpected medical emergencies happen, it does cripple the focus of your investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you are so focused on your investment journey that you are not interested in building emergency funds. You have most of your funds in different asset classes &#8211; liquid and illiquid. If medical emergencies creep in, you tend to liquidate your funds from these asset classes. You bear pre-liquidation charges for or worse scenario, forced to sell at a loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sorts of emergencies, especially when they are recurring, are best tackled with emergency funds. It takes away the worries around liquidating your investment at the wrong time.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Building Target Savings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to stay afloat is upping your savings game. A disciplined way to do that is to have target savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do emergency funds help you with that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are emergencies, the first point of call is to dip inside your savings and solve this financial problem. But, when you have emergency funds, your savings are not disturbed as you only have to take from the emergency funds and sort the bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives you the peace of mind you need and the encouragement to keep up with your target savings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Loan Repayment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a loan you are servicing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you worried about what will happen to your financial wellbeing if an emergency creeps in while you are servicing this loan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your worries are justifiable!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency funds are here to your rescue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not having an emergency fund while servicing your debt can cause financial issues that could throw you into a debt cycle. You tend to borrow more to solve these emergencies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, emergency funds seem like another financial or investment jargon. Taking your time through the content of this article, you have realized how it plays a relevant role in ensuring your investment plans are intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be investment savvy, building an emergency fund is a must.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having some funds to solve problems without distorting your investments in other asset classes is key to achieving the level of financial astuteness you want to attain.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your quest for <strong>financial freedom</strong>, one of the fundamentals is savings. You reach mastery level in savings through discipline and tenacity of purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This discipline you have built over your course of saving mony will in no small way help you navigate the hurdles of investment and creating wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While saving money is excellent, the investment ecosystem changes quickly, building solid capital through savings is noble. And the best way to do that is to save faster than an average person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article looks at tips that help you save money faster and more efficiently.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>10 Sure Tips To Save Money Faster</b></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Understand Your Finances</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At every stage of your life, your financial state differs. To build your savings as fast as you want to, you must understand your finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your finances means having a good grasp of your income, financial obligations, expenses, and financial goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It invariably helps you understand where you are at every period of your investment journey to freedom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. Don’t Be Afraid To Start Small.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to save is to take out what you can afford to save right now. So many people are stuck in the frenzy of saving money at their convenience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start from any amount you can do away with and grow your funds from there. Waiting till you are more comfortable will only complicate your savings plans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Automate Your savings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the influx of FinTech in the financial ecosystem, your savings do not necessarily have to be as crude as it was years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You only need to come with the amount and time intervals you want. These fintech apps will do the rest and ensure that you can save your money with no hassle or problem of forgetting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. Automate your Bills</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automating your savings is a great thing, but very relevant automation to your savings journey is automating your bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a system or app that helps you deduct your bills from your account monthly will help you keep track of what is relevant and whatnot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reduces waste and increases extra funds for your savings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. Always Have a Budget</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All financial experts agree that the best way to control your investment journey is to have a solid budget for your money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This budget considers your income, bills, expenditures, debt servicing, savings, and other relevant use of your money. A solid budget does not need a complex formula or complicated model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need is a simple excel worksheet that helps you track your money habits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. Reduce your Grocery Spendings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to have more money for your savings is to cut back on recurring expenses. One of such expenses is your grocery spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much do you spend on groceries? Which of these groceries are not important? How much can you cut back from this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are questions that will give you pointers to what you need to remove from the list of groceries. Once you cut back on it, you have extra cash for your savings.</span></p>
<p><b>7. Cancel Unused Subscription</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is not a valuable subscription, cancel it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule of thumb is to subscribe when you need to use the service. Doing otherwise is not a smart financial move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscriptions have a way of creeping into your money and time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate all your recurring subscriptions and cancel those whose value is not clear or suitable for you at the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8. Improve Your Earning Power</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save more, you need to have more; and to have more, you need to earn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concentrating so much on cutting back on your expenses might not be the best way to increase your ability to save more and faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you thought about improving your earning power?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One sure way to do that is by improving your skills and expertise in a high-income space. Doing this will invariably position you better to earn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certifications, training, changing jobs, and others are relevant ways to improve your income.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. Have a Side Hustle</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from building your competence and skills on the job, another sure way to improve your income is to have a side hustle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A side hustle could be a business of some sort. It helps you get extra income for your savings goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you build this side hustle, you are also leaning towards investing in a business that would improve your income. The success of this hustle could be the tipping point for your investment journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>10. Splurge When You Can</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about taking care of yourself while trying to save faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy the good things of life too! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have worked so hard, time to have a taste of the goodies as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take yourself to a treat &#8211; enjoy good foods and a great ambiance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are wondering how this helps your investment journey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save more and faster, you need to have a clear head and have a taste of what you will enjoy when you are financially stable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splurge once in a while. But, be sure you can afford it!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving money is not as tedious as it seems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You only have to be disciplined and dedicated to what you are saving for and why it is relevant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving your goals; understanding your expenses, cutting back on expenditure, enjoying the fruits of your work, and building a budget are tips that increase your savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always remember that the goal is not to save. Savings help you build capital that makes it easy to get <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/investments/">investment</a> opportunities that improve your chances of financial freedom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situations of life are unpredictable, especially when it comes to finances. One minute, you have everything figured out. The next minute, you are struggling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who opt to take loans are financially savvy individuals who need to sort unexpected expenses or use funds for urgent investment purposes. It is contrary to the general notion that borrowers are not financially astute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To exhibit true financial smartness, it has become important to carry out due diligence on the loan firm before accepting to do business together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a lot of loan firms also comes with its cons &#8211; some firms disguised their mediocrity and unprofessionalism.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>What are the five(5) things to consider when choosing a loan firm?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not matter if it is your first or tenth time accessing loans. The insight below would help you make better decisions. </span></p>
<p><b>1. The Company&#8217;s Credibility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most important of this list. You have to distinguish between the real players in that space and the wannabes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means that you have to confirm the existence of the firm. The reviews from other customers. How long they have been in the business and how successful they have been over that period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they a registered company? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do they have an office address? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have they been in the news for the wrong reasons?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to all these questions will help you form a concrete credibility scorecard for the firm. It would inevitably help you make solid decisions. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Service Delivery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great companies who create suitable solutions for clients are always intentional with their service delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before accepting to do business with that loan firm, one of the things to confirm is how well they treat customers. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How well do they respond to inquiries? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How quick is their complaints resolution? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you access their products online? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they active on social media platforms?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they have walk-in customers, are they courteous or indifferent in their approach?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these give you an insight into how they will treat you when you agree to be their customers. Reviews are one great way to see what other people are saying about the brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><b>3. Data Privacy &amp; Confidentiality</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During KYC, loan firms ask for relevant questions to enable them to profile you accordingly. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you confident that the information you provided is safe with them?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you guaranteed that the details of your transactions are secured?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have to be worried about data leakage? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is significant!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are cases of loan firms sending nasty messages to friends and families of their customers &#8211; labeling them all sorts of names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure you do not want to fall into this disheartening situation.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Interest Rates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way <a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com">loan firms</a> compete in the market is with rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a client, shopping for the best rate is excellent. Knowing the cost of the funds you are accessing is a no-brainer in this space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest rate is the extra you pay for the loan. A firm considers several things before a firm puts up an interest rate. Creditworthiness and income are a couple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower the rate, the better it is. And, do not make decisions solely on the interest rates as this could be incomplete research.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Repayment Flexibility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income and expenditures go a long way in determining your financial capacity. Your financial capacity is key in debt servicing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real work is not in getting the loan. It is in repaying the loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not go ahead with that loan without knowing their repayment structure? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it align with your financial capacity? If not, are they willing to restructure it to fit your purse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to these questions are relevant as they will guide you aright so you will not make a rash financial decision. As much as getting the loan is elating, your ability to pay it back without hurting your financial wellbeing is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not be scared of having a conversation with the firm before opting for their service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At times, a better tenor is all you need to help you fit the repayment very well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION/SUMMARY</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you have it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial shrewdness is not magic. It is knowing and doing what works for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do proper research before opting for that firm&#8217;s loan &#8211; your financial wellbeing and peace of mind are crucial.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The taste of financial freedom is nothing short of ecstatic. It is a gift to live debt-free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living debt-free is gradually becoming a myth as the economic situation stifles financial decision-making. You will agree with me that debt is not necessarily a bad thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It becomes a problem when you allow it chokes you. Understandably, financial emergencies could happen to anyone. And the easiest route to tackle this is through loans. That is not to say, living debt-free is impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, I will drop you these tips to help you navigate this debt cycle.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2055" src="https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-scaled.jpg" alt="Debt Cycle: 5 Tips To Help Break It!" width="660" height="440" srcset="https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://fundquestnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/horizontal-shot-desperate-young-afro-american-woman-freelancer-holding-hands-her-head-feeling-stressed-panic-because-deadline-computer-problem-standing-desk-with-open-laptop-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><b>1. Analyze Your Debts</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not keeping track of your debts is the fastest route to entering a debt cycle. This single act is capable of denying the financial freedom that you seek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan firms make the details of your loan accessible when needed. It means that you have to know how much you are owing and how long you have until you finish the repayment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When doing this analysis, it is relevant to put the following in mind:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cumulative amount of all pending loans</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest rate of each loan so you can prioritize repayment efficiently</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repayment time frame for all pending loans</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have all this information, you need to find out how best to knock them off.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Analyze Your Income</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income is the only means by which you can tackle your loans. The more knowledge you have about your income, the better your chances of using it to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To analyze your income, you must know the following like the back of your palm:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every penny that enters into accounts &#8211; salaries, bonuses, tips, and others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must understand every penny that leaves your account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be able to calculate your cash flows.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must not allow lifestyle to cripple your inflows.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment you check this box, building a plan is next.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Create A Concrete &amp; Workable Plan</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will keep living in the dreamland of financial freedom without solid plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easier to want to do something. It is harder to take actionable steps to make things come alive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be up and doing with the plan, it has to be something you can do for a while. Concrete and workable plans give better chances of escaping the debt cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your plan might be to improve your income, minimize your expenses, knock off the high-interest loans, or stop taking additional loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever your plan, discipline, and focus are vital to achieving desired results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s quickly get to the next one.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Live Within Your Means</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you get into this debt cycle due to poor personal choices?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you living a glamorous lifestyle and building up debt?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, wait!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you spend more than you earn?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the answer to these questions is YES, you have an easy way route out of this cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have been living above your means &#8211; that is what brought you here. The way out is to start living within your means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand your needs and be deliberate about sorting them out while improving your disposable income. It helps you service your loans smartly.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Build An Emergency Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You seem surprised at this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I figured you would be!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a world where you do not have to resolve to get loans to solve the slightest financial emergency that comes up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just picture you have a pool of funds to take from during an emergency. That feeling is surreal, and you can feel the same without doing the impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that you might be unable to build this while repaying your loans. What you need to do is have it as a top priority &#8211; so that you can start saving as little as possible towards it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency funds improve your financial freedom as you have something to fall back to when life happens.</span></p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attaining financial freedom through breaking out of the debt cycle is not easy. But, it is doable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With discipline and focus, you can repay all your<a href="https://fundquestnigeria.com/loans/"> loans</a> and build a solid emergency fund that helps you stay clear of falling into the trap again.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand the enthusiasm around getting loan/funds to sort out pressing bills when it&#8217;s urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the frenzy is in gear, have you considered the concepts associated with the loans?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your answer is no, you need to read this to the last word. The goal is to expose you to the stuff that helps you make the best decisions on your loan applications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the concepts to get accustomed to before you sign that loan offer letter.</span></p>
<p><b>1. Loan Firm’s Background</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessing loan facilities has become easier as more companies are positioning well to address the problems associated with accessing funds. It, in a way, comes with a disadvantage as there are organizations whose goal is to extort the clients due to inadequate financial literacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get reviews and insights from clients who have used their products. It helps you make rational decisions &#8211; you do not want to end up with a firm that will keep harassing you and your families just in the name of loan repayment.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Interest Rates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is the only thing you will pick from this content, please let it stick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rate is one of the deal-breakers for most people. The sad part is that most people do not understand how important this is. To reiterate, this helps to calculate how much more you will be paying to the lender (the loan firm).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can help you analyze the loan to be sure it is financially solid, or the firm is just ridiculously pricey with its product offerings. </span></p>
<p><b>3. Credit Rating/Worthiness</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every loan firm that wants to remain in business needs to pay good attention to the creditworthiness of the proposed clients. Credit rating is how well you have been without being responsible with your credit facilities &#8211; the more you pay when due, the greater your credit ratings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, loan firms take solace in your creditworthiness as a way to affirm to themself that you will not ghost on them when it is time for repayment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple terms, the better your credit ratings, the less scrutiny you get while accessing loans. </span></p>
<p><b>4. Debt-To-Income</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to attest to your ability to pay back the loan is through your income. When income is insufficient to offset your loan repayment, there is a problem. At this point, there is no point in accessing such a loan as this could turn out to be a poor financial decision for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTI is the percentage of your monthly income that goes into debt servicing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to understand DTI as it helps you know how much you can access and how best your income covers it without unnecessary complications.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Repayment Structure/Plan</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more thing to critically analyze is the repayment structure. It is how the company wants you to repay your debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is significant to you as it helps analyze if the conversation around rates and tenor is in sync with the final offer letter you have in your hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repayment structure mostly has a part of your principal and interest summed up for monthly deduction. Adding all the principal payment up and comparing it with the amount you want to borrow helps you confirm that there are no extra funds on the principal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, reconciling the interest rates and the interest element of the repayment plan helps you reaffirm the credibility of the loan firm.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that your income and credit ratings are relevant to how much loan you can access for a certain period. As much as the firm is doing a KYC on you, you must run a sort of KYL (Know Your Lender). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your repayment structure is the best way to confirm the validity of the interest rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of how rapidly you want the funds, you must get all these boxes ticked before signing the loan document. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What if you have an investment that pays you every month or any such intervals? For me, that would be the ideal definition of money working for you. It is what a secured income plan represents.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let me try to explain further. Say, for example, you invest in a debt or equity security with a directive to produce cash flows while preserving capital.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A <strong>secured income plan</strong> provides a steady income stream as dividend and interest payments. It is great for retired persons who no longer have a good source of income. Pensioners can also invest in this.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most times, investment is in lower-risk securities, and this includes fixed-income instruments, preferred shares, and dividend stocks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a country like Nigeria with all the economic fluctuation and inflation, this income plan could be the best fit for pensioners or aged parents who depend on their children for their monthly upkeep. The children could invest money on behalf of the parents to avoid the monthly hassle of sending money to the parents.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sometimes, it feels good for one to make their own money. Senior citizens are not left out of this inherent need. Investing in a secured income plan gives that rush of blood and excitement. It makes them feel the independence we all crave.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The secured income plan allows for liquidation before maturity as long as pre-liquidation fees are charged on interest. This means that your money is available to you anytime, and it is not tied down until the maturity period is reached.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The minimum amount you can invest is N100,000, and it has no maximum limit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For a secured income plan, the minimum tenure is 3 months and a maximum of 1 year and is renewable. The interest rate is fixed and the investment amount can be rolled over.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot can be said about a secured income plan. The best that can be said is about its benefits. I imagine my investment working as a side hustle for me. I can get paid every month from my investment while doing my regular job. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It makes a lot of financial sense. It offers different options, especially when the idea of black tax comes into play.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I could set my family up with a secured income plan and just relax while the plan takes care of them.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early last year, I lost my phone on my way to work. I was exposed to the reality of being disconnected from family and friends (I live alone). I was stranded, and I desperately needed a new one.</p>
<p>The problem was that I didn’t have enough money to replace my phone at that particular time, and I couldn’t burn a hole the size of N100,000 in my pocket at a go.</p>
<p>Guess what I did… I used the only available option at the time. I used the Buy Now Pay Later service. In the long run, I had to pay far more than the actual cost of the device. An upfront payment was made as collateral.</p>
<p>The payment was spread over 4 months, and it let me breathe (financially).</p>
<p>So here is “asset lease”. It enables you to use a device or equipment and the benefits of ownership. The financier retains actual ownership of the equipment, which will be transferred to you when payment is completed.</p>
<p>I wish that I knew about this service when I lost my phone. It would have saved me from the stress of changing my budget to accommodate paying for a new phone.</p>
<p>This takes a lot of financial strain off your shoulders and allows you to meet other needs and responsibilities. Repaying for asset lease can be spread over 18 months (depending on your financial capability) to reduce the stress to the barest minimum.</p>
<p>I like this arrangement because it considers the income of would-be users of the product. Asset lease also removes even the rate of inflation. In order words, you only pay the cost of the product at the time you are taking possession, regardless of its cost by the time you are paying the last instalment.</p>
<p>Our “lease to own service” is unique in many ways. It is designed to accommodate upwardly mobile people who are still in their financial growth stage. At this stage of life, individuals have many different needs and responsibilities calling for attention. It is more so in a country like Nigeria. Asset lease gives you a means to reduce stress is always welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Outright purchase sounds great for certain products. For some other products, it makes more sense to lease them over time. Asset lease is not limited to phones or mobile devices. It is open to wide range of products including large industrial equipment to help run your business. In the end, it depends on the product and what use it will be put to. Financial freedom is what is on offer. To access it, please visit us at <a href="http://www.fundquestnigeria.com">www.fundquestnigeria.com</a></p>
